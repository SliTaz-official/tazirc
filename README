TazIRC - The SliTaz IRC tools
================================================================================


TazIRC provides a small command line IRC client and an IRC Log Bot. Both are 
entirely written in SHell script and use Busybox nc and libtaz functions.
TazIRC can connect to all standardized IRC daemons, handle cmdline options and
doesn't have a configuration file. Run tazirc/tazirc-lb without arguments to 
get a short usage and list of options. See below for some usage examples.


Installation
------------

# make install


TazIRC Usage
------------
You can simply connect to a server, then join a channel or directly join a channel
using the --chan= option on cmdline. Run tazirc without arguments to get a short
usage and list of options. Let's connect to SliTaz IRC channel on freenode as the
duly famous user tux:

$ tazirc irc.freenode.net tux --chan=slitaz

You can also connect to a server, then join a channel with:

$ tazirc irc.freenode.net tux
$ /join #slitaz

TazIRC will handle a few short IRC commands:

/j: JOIN
/q: QUIT


TazIRC Log Bot Usage
--------------------
TazIRC-lb, the IRC Log Bot can be combined with conspy or screen to have local or
online archives of various IRC channels. Let's log the official SliTaz channel on 
Freenode:

$ tazirc-lb irc.freenode.net slitaz

Use Ctrl-c to exit. You will find the logs in the current directory or you can
use the --dest= option to set the output logs path.


Translation
-----------
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazbox.pot
	
To update all pot files when some new strings have been added (mainly for
developers before commit) and to update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make pot && make msgmerge
